3. Create a character variable to store your **grade** and print it.
4. Create a string variable to store your **city name** and print it.
5. Create two variables (one integer, one float) and print them in the same line.


## 3️⃣ Constants

1. Create a constant integer with value **10** and print it.
2. Create a constant float to store **pi = 3.14** and print it.
3. Create a constant for **number of days in a week** and display a message using it.

## 1️⃣ Literals

### 📘 Explanation
A **literal** is a **fixed value written directly in the program**.  
Its value does **not change** while the program runs.

Common literals:
- Numbers (whole or decimal)
- Characters
- Text (strings)
- Boolean values (`true`, `false`)

---

### ❓ Practice Questions
1. Write a program that prints an **integer literal**.
2. Write a program that prints a **floating-point literal**.
3. Write a program that prints a **character literal**.
4. Write a program that prints a **string literal**.
5. Write a program that prints a **boolean literal**.

---

## 2️⃣ Typed Constant Expressions (`const`)

### 📘 Explanation
A **typed constant expression**:
- Has a **fixed data type**
- Cannot be changed after creation
- Is checked by the compiler

Trying to modify it causes a **compile-time error**.

---

### ❓ Practice Questions
1. Create a constant integer and print it.
2. Create a constant float and use it in a calculation.
3. Create a constant character and print it.
4. Try changing the value of a constant and observe the error.
5. Use a constant inside a printed message.

---

## 3️⃣ Preprocessor Definitions (`#define`)

### 📘 Explanation
`#define` works **before compilation**.  
It performs **simple text replacement**.

Key points:
- No data type
- No scope rules
- Mostly used for fixed values or macros

---

### ❓ Practice Questions
1. Define a constant number using `#define` and print it.
2. Use `#define` to store item price and calculate total cost.
3. Define a text message using `#define` and print it.
4. Change the `#define` value and observe output change.
5. Compare behavior of `#define` with `const`.

---

## 4️⃣ Character and String Literals

### 📘 Explanation
- **Character literal**
  - Written using **single quotes**
  - Represents **one character**
- **String literal**
  - Written using **double quotes**
  - Represents **multiple characters**

They are **not the same** in C++.

---

### ❓ Practice Questions
1. Print a single character using a character literal.
2. Print your name using a string literal.
3. Print the same letter once as a character and once as a string.
4. Store a character in a variable and print it.
5. Store a string in a variable and print it.

---

## 5️⃣ Raw Strings

### 📘 Explanation
A **raw string**:
- Does **not process escape characters**
- Prints text exactly as written
- Is useful for file paths, regex, and multi-line text

Raw strings use this format:
R"( text )"


---

### ❓ Practice Questions
1. Print a file path using a normal string.
2. Print the same file path using a raw string.
3. Print a multi-line message using a raw string.
4. Write a raw string containing quotation marks.
5. Compare output of a normal string and a raw string.
